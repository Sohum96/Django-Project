This is a real world example(with depricated personal information)(we guess it seems so). And the solution is correct!
Here HIR, HTA both belong to the same branch and have the same CPI. However, when one of the two gets the 
branch change the other is also given a branch change even though the strength of the parent branch falls below 
the lower limit! 
Also, branch strength was extended to accomodate HRY, MAY as both had same CPI and one got branch change.
